--- Trait definitions.
-- Traits can be used to make factions more unique in terms of their reaction to certain external influence, but also on terms of how they are perceived by other forces.
-- The numeric values are to be treated as percentages, so if you want to boost a rating use a value x > 1.0, if you want to reduce a rating use a value 0.0 <= x < 1.0, If you don't wan the attribute to be influenced use a multiplier of x = 1.0.
-- Currently used values are:
-- @usage
-- ["TRAITNAME"] = {
--     MilitaryPowerMult       = 1.000, -- The faction's military power is multiplied by this modifier.
--     MilitaryInfluenceMult   = 1.000, -- The faction is more/less susceptible to military intimidation.
--     DiplomaticPowerMult     = 1.000, -- The faction's diplomatic influence is diminished/boosted by this amount.
--     DiplomaticInfluenceMult = 1.000, -- The faction is more/less influenced via diplomatic means.
--     MaintenanceMult         = 1.000, -- Does the trait influence the maintenance cost of units.
-- },
-- Traits have been expanded to also support objects. Being a diplomat now is a object trait, this allows for faster filtering and better reaction to circumstances.
